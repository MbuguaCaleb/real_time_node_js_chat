**Websockets**

```
The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.

It allows two way communication to a server whereby unlike http where a client must make a request then wait to receive a response web sockets is two way.

sand we do not have to do refresh like traditional http requests.

```

**Project concepts**

```
The public folder with our front end has to be set as a static folder so as
to be accessed via the node js backend.

This is how you serve a frontend to a backend via a port.
